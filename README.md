# 2. CNN using Iris Features (Image-style Classification)
## ✅ Improved Code – Key Points

Converted Iris numerical features into 2×2 image format

Applied feature normalization for stable CNN training

Used a lightweight CNN architecture suitable for small data

Added clear prediction output with flower class name

Displayed the feature-image with predicted class for visibility

## 📘 README – Key Points

Iris dataset does not contain images; hence features were reshaped into image form

CNN was used to learn spatial relationships among features

Model classifies Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica

Output clearly displays predicted flower category

Approach demonstrates innovative use of CNN on tabular data

# 4. LSTM Time-Series Forecasting (Airline Passengers)
## ✅ Improved Code – Key Points

Removed hard-coded dataset path for portability

Added reusable time-series dataset creation function

Clearly reshaped data for LSTM input requirements

Improved visualization of predictions vs actual data

Used RMSE for proper model evaluation

## 📘 README – Key Points

LSTM model predicts airline passenger traffic over time

Data normalized using Min-Max scaling

Time-step window captures temporal dependency

Model performance evaluated using RMSE

Results show effective learning of sequential patterns
