# 2. CNN using Iris Features (Image-style Classification)
## ✅ Improved Code – Key Points

Converted Iris numerical features into 2×2 image format

Applied feature normalization for stable CNN training

Used a lightweight CNN architecture suitable for small data

Added clear prediction output with flower class name

Displayed the feature-image with predicted class for visibility

## 📘 Key Points

Iris dataset does not contain images; hence features were reshaped into image form

CNN was used to learn spatial relationships among features

Model classifies Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica

Output clearly displays predicted flower category

Approach demonstrates innovative use of CNN on tabular data
